        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
            <div>
                <p>One of my many interests is video gaming. Most coders love games, its just in our nature to love games. Either those games are tabletop games or video games it doesnt really matter we all love games and I am no exception to this. 
                    Right now my favorites games are Rainbowsix siege, Ark: Survival evolved and CS:GO. I love my fps's but I also love my survial games too.
                    Video games are a great way to kill time and have fun while doing it.</p>
                <p>Another of my interests is music. I have been playing the cello for a little over 8 years now and I have gotten quite good at it. Although recently I havent really practiced much,
                    I still love playing the cello. I also love listening to music, I am almost always listening to music unless im sleeping. I am currently listening to lofi beats as I write this.
                    I love all sorts of music from rap and dubstep all the way to classical. I love all genres of music(yes even country) I just need to be in the right mood to be listening to some
                    generes.</p>
                <p>My last interest that I will be sharing with you on this webpage is Welding. I have always loved making stuff with my hands. It is why I am majoring in computer science, because I geto make
                    anything as long as I can imagine it. I have been welding for about 3 years and I have loved every bit of it. I love making new things with my own two hands. Id love to have my own personal
                    Welder but those are just very expensive so I havent welded in quite a while but it still is one of my interests in life.</p>
